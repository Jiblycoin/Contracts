# Tokenomics Overview

This document outlines Jiblycoinâ€™s supply, allocation, fee structure, deflationary mechanisms, and incentive systems.

## 1. Initial Supply & Allocations
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 JIBLY tokens.
- **Wallet Allocations**:
  - **Admin Wallet**: 5%
  - **Main Wallet**: 55%
  - **Development**: 15%
  - **Rewards/Airdrops**: 10%
  - **Collaboration/Marketing**: 5%
  - **Burn Address**: 5%
  - **Buyback Wallet**: 5%

## 2. Fee Structure
- **Base Fee**: 1% (subject to adjustment by the dynamic `marketConditionFactor` from the Oracle)
- **Redistribution Fee**: 2%
- **Burn Fee**: 1%
- **Buyback Fee**: 1%
- **JiblyHood Fee**: 0.5%

Fees are deducted on transfers and then distributed to the appropriate wallets or pools. The dynamic factor provided by the Oracle (which may be influenced by market conditions) allows the base fee to scale up or down.

## 3. Deflationary Mechanisms
- **Automatic Burn**: A fraction of every transaction is burned (sent to a designated burn address).
- **Manual Burn & Buyback**: Admins can trigger monthly burns or buybacks if certain thresholds are met.
- **Staking Rewards**: Rewards are distributed from dedicated incentive pools rather than minting new tokens, ensuring no net inflation.

## 4. Loyalty & Referral System
- **Loyalty Rewards**: Tokens are reserved for loyalty bonuses based on holding duration and staking participation.
- **Referral Incentives**: A multi-level referral system rewards both the referrer and the referee.
- **NFT Integration**: Ownership of JiblycoinNFTs may yield additional loyalty points or fee discounts.

## 5. Long-Term Goals
- **Circulating Supply Reduction**: Regular burns to gradually lower the token supply.
- **Holder Incentives**: Encourage long-term holding and staking to reduce selling pressure.
- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Enable broader liquidity by supporting cross-chain transfers via Allbridge.
